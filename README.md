GSpec is a concurrent, minimal, extensible and reliable testing framework in Go
that makes it easy to organize and verify the mind model of software. (comming
soon).

Goals:

* It should be natual to write readable and runnable specifications.
* It should be an enhancement rather than replacement to "go test".
* It should be reliable by robust design and 100% test coverage.
* It should be minimal and extensible.
