Package gspec is an expressive, reliable, concurrent and extensible Go test framework
that makes it productive to organize and verify the mind model of software.

	- Expressive: a complete running specification can be organized via both BDD and table driven styles.
	- Reliable:   the implementation has minimal footprint and is tested with 100% coverage.
	- Concurrent: run test cases concurrently or sequentially.
	- Extensible: customizable BDD cue words, expectations and test reporters.
	- Compatible: "go test" is sufficient but not mandatory to run GSpec tests.
