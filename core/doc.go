Package gspec is a Go testing framework that makes it easy to organize and
verify the mind model of software.

Design goals:

	- It should be natual to write readable and runnable specifications.
	- It should be an extension rather than replacement to "go test".
	- It should be reliable by robust design and 100% test coverage.
	- It should be minimal and extensible.
